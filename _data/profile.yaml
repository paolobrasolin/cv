  I am a versatile individual with a penchant for learning, fueled by ambition and **fierce curiosity**.
  Programming is a vocation I embrace with the clear, **logical mind** forged by my scientific background.
  Born an individualist, I grew enamoured with the mutual empowerment of **teamwork**.

  I care about people and processes as more than a means to an end.
  I relish and thrive on **challenges**.
  I'm driven by the **impact** of what I build, be it the generality of a theorem or the life improvements for a product's users.
  In short, I don't seek jobs; I seek purposeful **missions** I can align with.
