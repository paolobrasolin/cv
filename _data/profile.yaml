body: | # prima quello che offro, poi quello che cerco
  I am an adaptable individual with a penchant for learning, fueled by ambition and **fierce curiosity**.
  Programming is a vocation I embrace with the clear, **logical mind** forged by my scientific background.
  Born an individualist, I grew enamored with the mutual empowerment of **teamwork** in the last years.

  I care about people and processes as more than a means to an end.
  I relish and need **challenges**.
  My drive springs from the **resonance** of the artifacts I build, be it measured in the generality of a theorem or
  in the life improvements a product brings to its users.
  In short, I am seeking a **mission**.
